# grunt-release-component

Grunt plugin to release the compiled / generated files from a project to a separate repository. For instance the source code for [Thorax](http://thoraxjs.org) lives here:

https://github.com/walmartlabs/thorax

But the bower component lives here:

https://github.com/components/thorax

This plugin is designed to be run after something like [grunt-release](https://github.com/geddski/grunt-release
).
